  'cons': "Although the trainings are remote, you can't combine them even with any other part time job - sometimes you have no time for lunch. No life-work balance at all for the duration of the program (almost 10 months)",

  'pros': "before i start the review wanted to write a piece of a  poem\r\nSuccess is counted sweetest\r\nBy those who ne'er succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\ni Dont write reviews much but writing now as it a review well deserved. After being ignoredby like tens of companies after interviewing with them I was contacted ny a person from synergisticit who told about the program and told me it cost like 30 grand. I thought the person was crazy expecting me to shell that much amount when i had already spent a ton of $$$ for my bachelors .\r\n\r\nDid some research , read some stuff looked at reviews and stuff (felt undecided still) contacted some of their alumni over linkedin and then i decided to take the plunge. Paid like 10 grand upfront by maxing out 2 of my credit cards and some savings as i felt it was worth taking the plunge. I figured if I invested 10k and after 6 months or so got a job for 75k or more it would be worth it and i could recover my investment.\r\n\r\ntook me 7 months in total to complete everything get prepped up and get 2 job offers one at 105k and another at 110k  and I for once made the right decision which was a big decision and a big investment.\r\n\r\nI remember i had tears of joy when i got the email from the 1st employer about the job offer. God bless synergisticit and Ashish for helping me start on my technology career.\r\n\r\nThe pain which i felt when i was rejected by so many employers and the joy i had when i finally got my offer can only be surmised by the emily blunt poem that you only appreciate success only and only once you have faced so many setbacks and defeats.\r\n\r\nNot going to recommend anyone about what to do or not to do. hundreds of places maybe thousands in our country for doing what synergisticit does but i guess Ashish summed it up best when he said its not what you do what matters but how you do it and how you execute and what leads to the final outcome. If after doing education or whatever you dont get a job then the whole process is just a waste of time.\r\n\r\nI am glad with me it was not. They delivered what they promised and they are honest . I am sure there may be others out there still after speaking to maybe like 30 of my friends i found them to be the best in terms of the end result.\r\n\r\nI wish synergisticit the best and the best to whosoever joins them as their motto is rightly so - the best programmers in the bay area. period",
  'cons': 'their pitch to have candidates join their program can be improved. They also had some jobs posted which kind of made it weird. If they have a good advertising program like other bootcamps do they will get thousands of candidates as their results are the best amongst everyone at least I am aware of . Even people from stanford joined synergistict but maybe they dont so many people.',
